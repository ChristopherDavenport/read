Read Typeclass for Scala. Controversial? Yes. Problematic? Yes. Better than watching
your friends write `string.toInt` and calling it good enough? Absolutely!

## Quickstart

To use read in an existing SBT project with Scala 2.11 or a later version, add the following dependency to your
`build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.chrisdavenport" %% "read" % "<version>"
```
